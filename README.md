# VLSI-LAB-EXPERIMENTS
AIM: To simulate and synthesis Logic Gates,Adders and Subtractor using Xilinx ISE.

APPARATUS REQUIRED: Xilinx 14.7 Spartan6 FPGA

PROCEDURE: STEP:1 Start the Xilinx navigator, Select and Name the New project. STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed. STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type. STEP:4 Type the File Name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it. STEP:5 Select the Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax. STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table. STEP:7 Select the Implementation in the Sources Window and select the required file in the Processes Window. STEP:8 Select Check Syntax from the Synthesize XST Process. Double Click in the Floorplan Area/IO/Logic-Post Synthesis process in the User Constraints process group. UCF(User constraint File) is obtained. STEP:9 In the Design Object List Window, enter the pin location for each pin in the Loc column Select save from the File menu. STEP:10 Double click on the Implement Design and double click on the Generate Programming File to create a bitstream of the design.(.v) file is converted into .bit file here. STEP:12 Load the Bit file into the SPARTAN 6 FPGA STEP:11 On the board, by giving required input, the LEDs starts to glow light, indicating the output.

xor x2 (sum,w1,c) ;
and al(w2,a,b) ;
and a2(w3,b,c);
and a3(w4,a,c) ;
or o1(w5,w2,w3) ;
or o2(cout,w5,w4) ;
endmodule

FULL SUBRACTOR

module full_sub(borrow,diff,a,b,c);
output borrow,diff;
input a,b,c;
wire w1,w4,w5,w6;
xor (diff,a,b,c);
not n1(w1,a);
and a1(w4,w1,b);
and a2(w5,w1,c);
and a3(w6,b,c);
or o1(borrow,w4,w5,w6);
endmodule
